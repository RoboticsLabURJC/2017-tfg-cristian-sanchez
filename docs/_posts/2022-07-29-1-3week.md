# Week 1
The first week, I dedicated my time to look into some TFM information about drones, also I set up my TFG github repository.

Once that was done, I installed all the software infrastructure and make sure that it was working properly:

1. ROS Noetic for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
2. MavRos
3. JdeRobot-drones

# Week 2
The next week, I started developing a simple teleoperator for Iris drone. I tried  some libraries and openCV was the best option, because it simplicity.

The idea behind this week, was to be able to command velocities using sliders.

This week also, I was introduce into kanban method, to organice the tasks of the project. 

# Week 3
Once the teleoperation functionality worked properly, we planned to extend it, adding a video screen that would show a front view, and also some buttons where the drone would perform some simple tasks such as:

1. Takeoff
2. Land
3. Turn specific angles/move specific distance
4. Stop
