	abstract="In Chap. 4, we discussed that programming could be thought of as input, process, and output. Sense, Think, ActSense, Think, Actis a similar paradigm used in robotics. A robot could be thought of rudimentarily as analogous to how a human or an animal responds to environmental stimuli. For example, we humans perceive the environment through the five senses (e.g. sight). We might then `decide' the following action based on these incoming signals and, finally, execute the action through our limbs. For example, you might see (sense) a familiar face in the crowd and think it would be good to grab their attention and then act on this thought by waving your hand.",
